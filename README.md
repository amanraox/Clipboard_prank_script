# Clipboard_prank_script

Reverses the contents of the clipboard as soon as they are copied.

For added fun, the reversal won't take place everytime. There's a probability parameter that you can control. The default is 75%.

added one more script 

# lfuq! mouse
Moves the mouse cursor to a random screen position every second.

Run the script and challenge a friend to do some task ;)
