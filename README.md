Silly pranks written in AHK.

Press M while holding Q to exit from any of the scripts, Of course you can disable this when running on your friends computer (naughty you!)

The effects of all of these are temporary. As soon as you exit the script, everything will be back to normal. I promise ;)

Warning: I can not be held responsible for any damage that could happen to your cat from the usage of these scripts... So, Excercise Caution.

You've been warned.

# Clipboard_prank_script

Reverses the contents of the clipboard as soon as they are copied.

For added fun, the reversal won't take place everytime. There's a probability parameter that you can control. The default is 75%.

added one more script 

# lfuq! mouse
Moves the mouse cursor to a random screen position every second.

Run the script and challenge a friend to do some task ;)
